    <description>This is where we start to learn the absolutely beautiful collaboration of colors that appear on the Screen. This can be treated as the true start of the Project. In terms of Analogy we can say we are learning “What a Program is?” in this week.&#xA;What is Computer Graphics? Computer Graphics is a field of Computer Science that deals with generating, manipulating, and displaying visual content on computer screen (Viewport).</description>

      <description>What is a Viewport? A viewport refers to the visible area through which content is displayed. For a Graphics/UI designer, a viewport is the visible part of the canvas on which he can perform his methods and manipulate colors and texts to visually express his art. In this project we can use the words graphic and art synonymously. We divide the graphic into simpler to manage UI elements and work on them one at a time.</description>
