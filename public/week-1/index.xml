      <description>Git is a distributed version control system that is used to track changes in the source code during software development. It is designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. It is widely used in the software industry and is a must-have skill for any developer.&#xA;Why use Git? Collaboration: Git allows multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously. It helps in managing conflicts and merging changes from different developers.</description>
