We covered the fundamentals of Git and GitHub this week. An assignment was floated to the mentees to create a GitHub repo and collaboratively work on a project. 

The repo can be found [here](https://github.com/devil973/graphics-and-shaders-assignment1gdc.git), contributed by [P1](https://github.com/coder-senpai123), [P2](https://github.com/devil973), [P3](https://github.com/Adyansu), [P4](https://github.com/Love2104)
